.TH TERMINAL-MEDIA-LAUNCHER-CONFIG 5

.SH NAME
terminal-media-launcher-config - terminal-media-launcher configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS
~/.config/terminal-media-launcher/config (or ~/.terminal-media-launcher/config)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The configuration file for terminal-media-launcher is a plain text file where commands regarding media groups and entries, along with various settings regarding layout, are specified. These commands are described in the next section. Each line is evaluated on its own, while empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.

A configuration file can be automatically generated if no such file is found. An automatically generated configuration file will create groups for Music, Pictures, and Videos, and add entries to each group from the respective directory in the user's home directory. It is highly recommended that the user edit the configuration file manually.

.SH COMMANDS
.SS Creating a Group
\fIterminal-media-launcher-config\fR requires at least one group.

\fBaddGroup\fR <name>
.RS
This command will create a new group with a specified name. By default, a new group is empty, with zero entries, no launching application specified, and no flags specified. If their is a space in the name, it must be written in quotes (ex. "TV Shows").
.RE

\fBsetLauncher\fR <group> <path>
.RS
This command will set a group's launching application. If no launching application is specified for a group, terminal-media-launcher will treat each entry in that group as an executable file. If their is a space in the path to the launching application, it must be written in quotes (ex. "/usr/bin/my launcher"). The path to the launching application should be absolute.
.RE

\fBsetLauncherRaw\fR <group> <path>
.RS
This command is identical to \fIsetLauncher\fR with the exception that the launcher application specified will not be wrapped in quotes for the system call when a member of the group is launched. This can be used to specify more complex launching instructions.
.RE

\fBsetFlags\fR <group> <flags>
.RS
This command will set the flags to be specified for the launching application. If no launching application is specified, any specified flags are ignored. If the specified flags contain a space, they must be written in quotes.
.RE

.SS Adding Entries
In order for a created group to be valid, it must contain at least one entry.

\fBadd\fR <path> <group>
.RS
This command will add a file to a specified group if the path exists. It can also be used to add mutiple files to a group in one line using the '*' operator (ex. add /home/john/Pictures/* Pictures). If the path to the file(s) contains space(s), it must be written in quotes.
.RE

\fBaddF\fR <new entry> <group>
.RS
This command will force an entry to be added to a specified group, regardless as to whether it is a valid file or not. Unlike \fIadd\fR, \fIaddF\fR's argument does not need to be a valid file, but \fIaddF\fR can only specify a single entry and does not support the '*' operator. If the arg has a space in it, it must be written in quotes.
.RE

\fBaddName\fR <name> <path> <group>
.RS
This command, like \fIadd\fR, will add an entry to a specified group if the path exists. \fIaddName\fR allows for a name to be specified for this entry (by default, the name is the same as the file name). Unlike \fIadd\fR, only one entry can be added per line, as \fIaddName\fR does not support the '*' operator. If either the name or file path contain a space, they must be written in quotes.
.RE

\fBaddNameF\fR <name> <new-entry> <group>
.RS
This command can be used in place of \fIaddF\fR if you want the forced argument to have a different name displayed for the entry than is called in the system call to launch the entry. Otherwise, it is effectively the same as \fIaddF\fR.
.RE

\fBaddR\fR <path> <group>
.RS
This command will recursively add entries to a group. \fIaddR\fR functions like \fIadd\fR, but will also search sub-directories for matches. 
.RE

\fBhide\fR <entry> <group>
.RS
This command will remove a specified entry from a specified group. The entry argument should refer to the entry's name, rather than the entry's path. This option may be useful to hide certain entries after adding many entries with the '*' operator.
.RE

\fBhideFile\fR <path> <group>
.RS
This command has the exact same functionality as \fIhide\fR, but takes the absolute path of the entry to hide as the first argument, instead of the name.
.RE

.SS Settings
Settings should be specified at the top of \fIterminal-media-launcher-config\fR

\fBautoAlias\fR on|off
.RS
This setting will attempt to automatically give entries more human-readable names by:

 1. Removing any characters inside parenthesis (including parenthesis)
 2. Replacing '-' and '\_' with a space character
 3. Replacing cases of multiple spaces in a row with only one space
 4. Removing file extensions (if the file has an extension) 

\fIautoAlias\fR is turned off by default.
.RE

\fBfoldCase\fR on|off
.RS
Entering any non-traversal input in terminal-media-launcher can be used to jump to a group or entry. For instance, hitting 'f' on the keyboard will jump the cursor to the next group or entry that starts with an 'f'. This setting determines whether or not this functionality is case insensitive (on) or case sensitive (off). \fIfoldCase\fR is turned on by default.
.RE

\fBsort\fR on|off
.RS
This setting will sort entries of each group in alphabetical order (though not the list of groups). Turning off \fIsort\fR is only recommended when adding one item per line to a group. \fIsort\fR is turned on by default.
