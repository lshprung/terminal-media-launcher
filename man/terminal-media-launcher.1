.SH NAME
terminal-media-launcher \- terminal media launcher

.SH SYNOPSIS
terminal-media-launcher [-c|--config PATH]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBterminal-media-launcher\fR is a TUI application designed to help streamline launching applications and other media. It aims to be a fast and minimal command line frontend with a Unix-like approach to setup and configuration. The program looks for a configuration file listing different groups of media and creates an ncurses menu from which the user can launch their media files.

Upon execution, the program will look for a configuration file. If a configuration file is found, the program will draw two columns: one for groups, and one for entries. At the bottom of the window, a preview of the command execution is displayed. If a configuration file is not found, the user will be prompted whether or not they would like to have a configuration file automatically generated.
